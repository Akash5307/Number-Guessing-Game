# Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game implemented in Rust. This game generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct, and uses colored text for better user experience. The user input is validated to ensure only valid guesses are processed.

## Features
- Random number generation within a specified range.
- User input handling with validation.
- Feedback on guesses (too low, too high, correct) with colored text.
